# Weather radar
## About

A weather radar app that shows

The weather data is retrieved from the [OpenWeatherMap Service](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Additional settings before starting

The application uses the  [OpenWeatherMap Services API](https://openweathermap.org/api). \

Registration for the service is free.\
The registration form can be found at: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up

After registration, you will receive an identifier (API key), 
which must be added to the project file at:

```
├─── weather-radar
     ├─── src
          ├───constants
              ├───> Constants.js

...    ...    ...    ...   ...   ...  ...

export const API_KEY = {API key};
```
After completing the steps above, you can run the project.
